'''Dropbox for Plex''' is a browser channel which enables you to watch and hear your
media directly from the cloud.

Please keep in mind that this channel will '''not transcode''' any content. So you have to make sure
that the content is viewable on your devices. If Plex will support any transcoding of streamed
content in the future, this feature can be implemented afterwards.

=== Donation ===
Since I'm developing in my free time I'd like to ask you to support my work.
You can do it by contributing 5 EUR via paypal. This will give me motivation
to keep on coding and fixing bugs.

Thanks in advance

=== Your decision ===
This channels supports the '''dropbox''' and '''sandbox''' mode from dropbox. The mode differs
from what this channel can access in your dropbox. '''dropbox''' mode is the god mode which
enables this channel to see all your files. If you'd like to jail this channel to a special
folder, you have to use the '''sandbox''' mode. You have to come to a decision when you'll
create an app within your '''own''' dropbox developer console.

=== Authorize access ===
You have to create an application within the [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps App Console] of Dropbox.
Afterwards you can use the '''Generate access token''' button to create a token which has to be configured
within the Plex channel. This allows the channel to access your Dropbox account with the given privileges.

'''Please secure you access token. NOBODY may know it! This token allows full access
to your configured dropbox space.'''

=== My last words ===
Have fun with this little goodie...
